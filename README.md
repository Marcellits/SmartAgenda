# SmartAgenda

**Description:** 
SmartAgenda is a web application for business owners to keep track of client information as well as appointments which are displayed on their calendar.

### Usage:
Upon account creation, business owners will have the ability to add clients to their clients list. From there, appointment invitations may be created, which will be sent with the use of the invite link provided. From that invite link, the client will confirm the appointment by picking a time and date which will then result in the business owner having the appointment added to their calendar.

## ROADMAP

For next releases, we intent to add the following features:

**Map integration**
Feature dedicated to mobile services Company. Users can manage their itinerary using geolocation to display all customers' addresses who have appointments in a specific day.

**Day and week view on Calendar**
Users can choose the best way to check appointments on the calendar using month, week or day view.

**Email Delivery Service** 
Users will be able to send the appointment scheduling link directly to customers’ emails.
